# Snail jumper
**Neuroevolution game assignment.**  
**Fall 2021 - Computer Intelligence.**  

This game has been developed as an assignment for students at Amirkabir University of Technology to apply neuroevolution using a simple game. 
Developed an evolutionary algorithm in Python to train a neural network in the Snail Jumper game environment where there is not enough data to learn. By defining a proper fitness function, crossover and mutation, after passing a few generations, the player outperformed the baseline by 50%.
