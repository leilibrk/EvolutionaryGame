**Neuroevolution game assignment.**  
**Fall 2022 - Computer Intelligence.**  

Developed an evolutionary algorithm in Python to train a neural network in the Snail Jumper game environment where there is not enough data to learn. By defining a proper fitness function, crossover and mutation, after passing a few generations, the player outperformed the baseline by 50%.
